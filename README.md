# Snort-Lab

## Objective

The Snort lab is designed to install and configure Snort 3 IDS on a virtual network, analyze malicious PCAP files, and create a basic signature.

### Skills Learned

- Snort 3 Deployment: Installed and configured Snort 3 IDS within a virtualized network environment to monitor and analyze network traffic.

- Intrusion Detection Configuration: Tuned Snort settings and modules to optimize detection capabilities for various threat scenarios.

- PCAP Analysis: Analyzed malicious PCAP files to identify indicators of compromise and understand attack behaviors.

- Signature Development: Created basic Snort signatures to detect specific malicious patterns observed in network traffic.

- Network Forensics: Gained foundational experience in interpreting packet-level data for threat investigation and response.

- Rule Testing & Validation: Tested custom Snort rules against known malicious traffic to ensure accurate detection and minimize false positives.

### Tools Used

- Snort 3: IDS for real-time traffic analysis and packet logging
- PulledPork: for managing and updating Snort rules and signatures
- VirtualBox: to build and manage the lab network environment
- Ubuntu Server: used as the host for Snort
- PCAP Files: Malicious network capture files used to simulate attack scenarios and test detection logic
